# Azure Site Recovery
This document is a suggested services and solution offering template on Azure Site Recovery - ASR, exclusively towards AzureCAT GSI Partners, who are interested in providing a) Azure Disaster Recovery, b) Azure Business Continuity and c) Virtual Machine lift & shift migration solutions and services towards their customers. Enterprise IT organizations are increasingly driven by business demands for faster, better solutions delivered more quickly than ever before.  DevOps has emerged as a trend to help organizations evolve to better collaborate between development and operations teams for addressing these solution delivery challenges.  While a DevOps transformation can take time to fully realize within an organization’s people and processes, there’s opportunities to accelerate the path towards DevOps by smartly leveraging cloud capabilities that can reduce infrastructure complexity, simplify release management, and support end-to-end application visibility through all stages of a solution’s lifecycle.  This session will discuss the features in Microsoft Azure that help to realize this transformation and how the platform enables integration with existing assets.
